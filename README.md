# Harshaan's Web Design Lab
This project collects my web design experiments into a single page application built with React.  
The React app is hosted on Github pages; it contains interactive previews of the work.    
> To use a component, simply copy and paste its folder to your components directory.  
> Also copy the `helper-components` folder to the same location.  
> If there are any dependencies, they will be commented at the top of the component's jsx file.

## Live Site
The live site demonstrates most of the components in action.  
* Use the navbar to select a category.
* Select a component to view a preview
* Select "Open" to open a new tab with the interactive component

Each Figma component has a matching React component with the same name.
